    <h3> My Hoverboard!</h3>
<p> My Hobby is riding my hoverboard, this is my one of my favorite hobby's.
Every weekend I try to ride my hoverboard so I can get practice.
I have been training inside of the house while having break times from school.
I have mastered the process of riding the hoverboard inside but outside not so much.
 I don't really spend time outside riding my hoverboard often because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 But if I remember to I will try to spend time riding my birthday gift from my dad.</p>
